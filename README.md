# Pitch-Classification

## Nolan McCafferty

This is a project that I completed for a job application for the New York Yankees. I built several models using the sklearn library in Python to predict the pitch type of future pitches given several variables including pitcherID, spin rate, initial x position, initial z position, x break, z break, extension, and initial speed.
